<div class="aboutBoard">
    Hello! My name is Hyun(He-On). I am currently studying at Columbia University in the city of New York, majoring in computer science with a focus on software systems.<br><br>
    I was a teacher assistant in C++ data structures at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, New York, for a year, and a programming club officer in charge of holding workshops 
    and programming competitions in order to make programming more fun while providing chances to apply the topics covered in data structures.<br><br>
    I have been extensively using C++, C and Python during my college years. The areas of work include software development, kernel programming, networks, databases 
    and intelligent systems. In addition, I consider myself very adaptable and well-versed in a wide variety of technologies, like Makefile, Git and cloud platforms 
    such as GCP and AWS.<br><br> As a programmer, my top priorities are readability, maintainability, elegance, efficiency and safety.
