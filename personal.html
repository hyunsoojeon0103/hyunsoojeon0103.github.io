    <i>"I must have been nine years old when my dad brought home a gray metal box and announced proudly, "This is a computer!" 
    The computer looked so fancy that I thought it should be in the cockpit of a plane. It had a dot matrix printer that made the coolest shrieking sound when it printed, 
    and my mind was immediately blown by the fact that a single Microsoft Encarta disc could replace dozens of encyclopedias! Totally captivated, I spent exuberant hours working with the computer, 
    and I took great pride in being able to install a program that required a stack of floppy disks..."</i><br><br>
    Hello! My name is Hyun(He-On). Above is a short story of my first encounter with a computer, and I am currently studying at Columbia University in the city of New York, 
    majoring in computer science with a focus on software systems. I am also a passionate singer and guitarist who enjoys creating acoustic covers of pop music, 
    old-school HipHop and R&B from the 90s and early 2000s. <br><br>
    Interestingly enough, I was an auxiliary policeman in South Korea, providing all policing services throughout the capital city Seoul where I developed a strong work ethic, 
    leadership, time-management and teamwork!<br><br>    
    Having spent two years in the Korean National Police Agency, I decided to channel my dedication to myself and came to the United States where I studied journalism since I loved writing, 
    and my inquisitive nature was drawn to the thrill of the chase. Down the road, however, I was fascinated by how technology was enabling social change on an unprecedented scale; 
    I was compelled to explore the landscape of how we interacted with technology everyday and decided to delve into programming myself.<br><br>
    You may ask what happened next? I loved every single step into this territory. It feels absolutely fantastic to see code that I wrote deployed in a live system and used by actual people, 
    especially if it improves their lives in some way. Moreover, what great satisfaction it gives to tackle a challenging problem and be able to come up with a solution. 
    I have realized that through programming I would be able to fulfill my soul's craving to make a contribution in shaping the world of tomorrow. 
    Each day, I walk further into it with a lighter step, and I strongly believe I have found my calling here.
